TerminalFormer is a platformer made inside the Linux terminal. 
TerminalFormer has three main levels that you can complete with a timer. The top five times for completing the main levels will be displayed on the main menu. 
TerminalFormer has a level editor that will save levels to a folder and let you access them. You can create new levels, edit levels, etc. 
have fun, ig...

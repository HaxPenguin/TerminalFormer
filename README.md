TerminalFormer is a platformer made inside the Linux terminal. 
TerminalFormer has three main levels that you can complete with a timer. The top five times for completing the main levels will be displayed on the main menu. 
There is a level editor for TerminalFormer as a separate package. This editor can be used to create levels and place them into a folder. 
TerminalFormer can access that folder, and you can play the custom levels you have made in the editor. 
Have fun!
